# Wine-Review-Prediction üç∑

Predicting wine quality from reviews using machine learning models.

## Overview

WineReviewPrediction tackles the challenge of predicting wine quality based on textual reviews. Leveraging TensorFlow, it offers two robust models: a Neural Network and an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model. Dive into the world of wine tasting and machine learning with this project!

## Key Features

- **Data Exploration and Preprocessing:** Uncover insights and prepare data for modeling.
- **Neural Network Model:** Harness pre-trained word embeddings for accurate predictions.
- **LSTM Model:** Capture sequential dependencies in textual descriptions for improved accuracy.
- **Model Evaluation:** Assess performance on a dedicated test dataset for comparison.

## Dataset

This project uses a comprehensive dataset sourced from Kaggle, featuring diverse wine reviews with descriptions, points, and more.
The dataset used for this project is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zynicide/wine-reviews).
